      <p className='text-left'>Hello! My name is Shriya Sudhakar, and I'm a current Sophomore at Cornell University studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. This past summer, I interned at Google on Mendel Lifecycle as a Full-Stack Engineer. The previous summer, I was at Bloomberg as a SWE Intern. I'm super involved at Cornell through many organizations such as WICC, Cornell Mars Rover, and Cornell Orchestras.</p>
